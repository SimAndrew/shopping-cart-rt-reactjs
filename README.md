Redux Toolkit (RTK) solves problems that most of the developer’s face who used redux in a react application. RTK abstracts the basic redux code and provides us boilerplates that enable us to write redux code in less lines of code

- https://axios-http.com/docs/intro Axios is a popular, promise-based JavaScript library for making HTTP requests from
browsers or Node.js, simplifying tasks like fetching data from APIs with methods like GET, POST, and DELETE. It offers
features like interceptors, automatic JSON transformation, and better error handling, making asynchronous network
operations cleaner and more efficient than native browser APIs.
